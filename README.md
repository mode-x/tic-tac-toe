This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Why

This is basically meant for learning React. I followed the tutorial [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to recreate and learn by doing. It was easy to follow and properly explained.

### `TODO`

As suggested at the end of the tutorial:

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

I will continue to explore these and other ways to improve the game while learning React.
